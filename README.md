# Experience-Weighted Attraction - Python Implementation

This project introduces the stepwise implementation of the Experience-Weighted Attraction model for economic learning, by Camerer, C., & Hua Ho, T. (1999).

The model implementation was done using Jupyter Notebooks, and it describes the learning simulation for the known "Pursue-Evade" game

This model implementation and game is based on Moffat (2020)'s original STATA implementation. 

The notebook is divided in three parts: 
 - Introductory overview
 - Model implementation
 - Exploratory Data analysis
